# ES6 Concepts Explained (Simple)

## 1) Difference between `var`, `let`, and `const`

  var: Function-scoped, can be re-declared and updated.\
  let: Block-scoped, can be updated but not re-declared.\
  const: Block-scoped, cannot be re-assigned after declaration.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 2) Difference between `map()`, `forEach()`, and `filter()`

map(): Creates a new array with modified elements.\
forEach(): Runs a function for each element, no new array
    returned.\
filter(): Creates a new array with elements that pass a
    condition.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3) Arrow Functions in ES6

Shorter way to write functions. They do not have their own `this`, they
use `this` from the outer scope.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4) Destructuring Assignment in ES6

A way to easily take values from arrays or objects and store them in
variables.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5) Template Literals in ES6

Strings written with backticks (`` ` ``). They support multi-line text
and let you insert variables directly using `${}`.
